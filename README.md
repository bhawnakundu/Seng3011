# Screenshots

Figure 1 shows globe with a pin marked, the popup shows the outbreaks happening at that place. We built a scraper that scrapes these outbreaks from different health organisation websites and the information is updated on day-to-day basis. This globe rotates and takes you to whatever pin you click on.
